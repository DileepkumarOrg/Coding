            (Hypertext Markup Language) uses a markup system composed of elements which represent specific
content. Markup means that with HTML you declare what is presented to a viewer, not how it is presented. Visual
representations are defined by Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and realized by browsers. Still existing elements that
allow for such, like e.g. font, "are entirely obsolete, and must not be used by authors"[1].
HTML is sometimes called a programming language but it has no logic, so is a markup language. HTML tags
provide semantic meaning and machine-readability to the content in the page.
An element usually consists of an opening tag element_name, a closing tag (</element_name>), which contain the
element's name surrounded by angle brackets, and the content in between:
...content...

        <p href="https:www.google.com">Hello</p>
    </body>
